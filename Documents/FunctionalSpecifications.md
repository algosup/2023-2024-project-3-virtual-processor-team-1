## I. Introduction
### 1. Project overview
The aim of the project is to design both a **virtual processor**[^1] and an **interpreter**[^2] capable of executing **assembly code**[^3], coded by us during the project. It will be developed in pure, portable **C language**[^4], relying solely on [standard C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library) **libraries**[^5], to the exclusion of any external **dependencies**[^6].

### 2. Project definition

#### 3.4 <u>Project reviewers</u>
The project owner has designated external project reviewers to meticulously examine our specifications and furnish us with constructive feedback.

### 4. Project plan

#### 4.1 <u>Resources/Financial plan</u>

In our custom assembly language project, we emphasise a cost-effective approach with no financial dependencies required for its development. Our focus is on optimising resource utilisation and ensuring efficient progress.

**Resource Allocation:**

- **Project Duration:** The project is scheduled to span over a total of 8 weeks

- **Personnel:** Our dedicated team consists of 6 skilled individuals who will actively contribute to different aspects of the project, including development, testing, and documentation

**Work Hours:**

To maintain a balanced workload and ensure steady progress, we have allocated a total of 399 hours (9 and a half days of work on the project, bearing in mind that half a day is 3.5 hours and that there are 6 of us in the team), distributed among team members as needed. This allocation is designed to optimise productivity while allowing for flexibility in addressing project challenges.

**Financial Independence:**

We take pride in stating that our custom assembly language project requires no external financial investment, which means our total budget is 0‚Ç¨. We have efficiently organised our resources to ensure that all development activities can be carried out within the scope of our existing capabilities and infrastructure.

By following this resource allocation plan and maintaining our financial independence, our goal is to successfully develop and deliver our custom assembly language, while adhering to the project's objectives and timelines.

#### 4.2 <u>Assumptions/Constraints</u>

When working with assembly language programming, it's important to consider certain assumptions and constraints to ensure the smooth execution of your code:

**Assumptions:**
1. **No Technical Issues:** We assume that the target computer system does not encounter any significant technical issues during the execution of the assembly code. This includes factors such as hardware failures, memory corruption, or system instability.

2. **Compatible Hardware:** The assembly code is assumed to be executed on hardware that is compatible with the assembly language instructions used. Compatibility issues can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

**Constraints:**
1. **Native Libraries:** The assembly code is constrained to utilise only native libraries and resources available on the target system. It should not rely on external libraries or resources that may not be present on the system.

2. **Low-Level Language:** Assembly language is inherently a low-level language, and as such, it may not offer the same level of abstraction and convenience as high-level programming languages. Developers should be prepared to work with raw memory, registers, and hardware interfaces.

3. **Minimal Abstraction:** Assembly language programming typically involves minimal abstraction, meaning that developers have to handle many low-level details themselves. This can make code more complex and require a deep understanding of the hardware architecture.

4. **Portability:** Assembly code is often not portable across different computer architectures. Code written for one architecture may not work on another without significant modifications.

5. **Manual Memory Management:** Assembly language programming often requires manual memory management, including allocation and deallocation of memory, which can be error-prone if not handled carefully.

6. **Limited High-Level Features:** Assembly language lacks many high-level features and abstractions found in modern programming languages, such as built-in data structures or complex control flow constructs.

7. **Limited Debugging Tools:** Debugging assembly code can be challenging, as it may have limited access to high-level debugging tools commonly available in higher-level languages.

### II. Explanation of How a CPU Works

In this section, we'll be talking about the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and how it works. We'll also be discussing assembly language, which is a type of programming language that's commonly used with CPUs. Specifically, we'll be looking at registers, which are super important for programming in assembly language. We'll dive into why assembly language is so useful for programming CPUs and how registers make it all possible.
#### 1. The CPU's inner workings

The central processing unit (CPU) is the fundamental element of a computing system, much like the brain responsible for managing the complex dance of data manipulation and instruction execution. Its importance lies in its capability to execute instructions and perform calculations, making it the foundation of computing. Let's take a more detailed look at how a CPU operates:

- **Instruction Execution:** At its core, a CPU is designed to carry out a wide range of instructions that form the basis of software programs. These instructions include various operations such as arithmetic computations, data handling, and control flow directives

- **Microarchitecture:** The internal architecture of a CPU is made up of complex circuits, including arithmetic logic units (ALUs), control units, and registers, all of which work together to manage the execution of instructions. ALUs perform arithmetic and logical operations, while control units manage the flow of instructions

- **Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle:** The CPU operates in a cycle referred to as the "Fetch-Decode-Execute" cycle. It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them to understand their meaning, executes the instructions, and stores any results as necessary
#### 2. The role of assembly language

Assembly language is a crucial link between the complex internal workings of a CPU and the human-readable code. It's a preferred choice for programming CPUs for various reasons.

Firstly, assembly language provides a low-level abstraction that allows programmers to communicate directly with the CPU. By offering a one-to-one correspondence with machine code, it provides precise control, making it a powerful tool.

Secondly, when it comes to efficiency, assembly code is highly optimized for the CPU's microarchitecture. This fine-grained control leads to faster and streamlined execution, making it a popular choice for programmers.

Lastly, assembly language can be tailored for specific CPU architectures, making it portable across different platforms. Programmers can optimize code for various processors while retaining the same logical structure, making it an adaptable tool for different projects.
#### 3. The indispensable role of registers

Registers, which are small, ultra-fast storage units within the CPU, play a critical role due to their unique capabilities. They serve as rapid storage locations for data during instruction execution, allowing for quick access to operands and temporary storage of intermediate results. By storing frequently used data in registers, CPUs minimize the need for slow memory access, resulting in significantly enhanced performance. Registers hold operands for arithmetic and logic operations, and they also retain vital information related to program control and state. Additionally, during context switching, registers play a pivotal role in saving and restoring register values, enabling the CPU to seamlessly resume execution from where it left off.

In summary, registers are a crucial component in CPU operations, providing lightning-fast and transient data storage along with control information. They are essential in optimizing instruction execution, and their efficient management plays a pivotal role in the CPU's ability to process data and execute complex tasks. Together with a robust CPU, the precision of assembly language, and the seamless use of registers, they form the bedrock of modern computing, enabling the execution of diverse tasks with precision and efficiency.

## III. Functional Requirements
We need to create our own assembler. To do this, we'll base ourselves on most existing assembler code, with the simple exception that we'll use different names for certain actions. Our assembler will be **32-bit**[^8] based, which is easily adaptable to today's computers.<br>
We won't be using the entire **x86 architecture**[^7], as we don't need as much memory space for this project. Also, the 32-bit architecture is easily usable on any of today's computers, and is more suitable for this project.
Our entire assembler is **case sensitive.**[^8].

> More technical, detailed and user-friendly documentation has been created for the project. This documentation can be accessed by [clicking here](https://algosup-t1.gitbook.io/asm2/), but below we prefer to keep a more explicit and less technical preview.


### 1. Registers
#### 1.1 <u>General registers</u>
We use 4 general registers to store data. These are 32-bit general-purpose registers.<br>
`R1`, `R2`, `R3`, `R4`

#### 1.2 <u>Address registers</u>
Address registers, are essential components of a processor, each capable of storing the memory address of another general-purpose register. These address registers enable the processor to efficiently access different areas of memory using the addresses stored in these registers, thus facilitating data management and the execution of operations in a computing environment.<br>
`A1`, `A2`, `A3`, `A4`

### 2. Operands

For all immediate values, we add a `#` in front of the value so that it is stored directly without passing through an address or anything else.
#### 2.1 <u>Addition - ADD</u>
The "ADD" (Addition) instruction is used in programming languages to add two values, or to add a value to a specified destination. In our assembly code, the "ADD" operation instruction uses the syntax :<br>
> `ADD DESTINATION, SOURCE`<br>
`DESTINATION` represents the location where the result of the addition will be stored (the DESTINATION is always a register).<br>
`SOURCE` represents the value to be added to the final destination.

**Applications:**<br>
Let's assume that the `R1` general register has a value of 10. We therefore add the value 15 to this register. To carry out this operation, we can proceed as follows:<br>
`ADD R1, #15` | Here, we `ADD` to `R1`, the value `15`.<br>
`Result : R1 = 25`

We can also add the value of one register to another, provided that both registers contain the same data types. We have `R3`, which contains the value 5 and `R4`, which contains the value 25. We want to increment the value of R4 by adding the value stored in R3. We must therefore indicate `R4` as `DESTINATION` and `R3` as `SOURCE`. To carry out this operation, we can proceed as follows: <br>
`ADD R4, R3` | Here, we `ADD` to `R4`, the value of `R3`<br>
`Result : R4 = 30`

**What not to do:**<br>
Let's imagine that our `R1` register contains the string "Hello, World!" and that our `R3` register contains the value 20. You can't do an `ADD`, as the program will try to understand that "Hello, World!" is a numerical value.<br>
You'll get a compilation error.

#### 2.2 <u>Subtraction - SUB</u>
The "SUB" (Subtraction) instruction is used in programming languages to subtract one value from another, or to subtract a value from a specified destination. In our assembly code, the "SUB" operation instruction uses the following syntax:<br>
> `SUB DESTINATION, SOURCE`<br>
`DESTINATION` represents the location where the result of the subtraction will be stored (the DESTINATION is always a register).<br>
`SOURCE` represents the value to be subtracted from the destination.

**Applications:**<br>
Let's assume that the general register `R1` contains a value of 20. We want to subtract the value 8 from this register. To perform this operation, we can proceed as follows:<br>
`SUB R1, #8` | Here, we use the `SUB` instruction to subtract `8` from `R1`.<br>
`Result : R1 = 12`

We can also subtract the value of one register from another, provided that both registers contain the same data type. Imagine we have `R4`, which contains the value 10, and `R3`, which contains the value 4. We want to decrement the value of R4 by subtracting the value stored in R3. To perform this operation, we can proceed as follows:<br>
`SUB R4, R3` | Here, we use the `SUB` instruction to subtract the value of `R3` from `R4`.<br>
`Result : R4 = 6`

**What not to do:**<br>
Imagine that our register `R1` contains the string "Hello, World!" and our register `R3` contains the value 5. You cannot use the "SUB" instruction in this case, as the program will attempt to interpret "Hello, World!" as a numerical value. <br>This will result in a compilation error.

#### 2.3 <u>Multiplication - MUL</u>
The "MUL" (Multiplication) instruction is used in programming languages to multiply two values together, or to multiply a value by another and store the result in a specified destination. In our assembly code, the "MUL" operation instruction uses the following syntax:<br>
> `MUL DESTINATION, SOURCE`<br>
`DESTINATION` represents the location where the result of the multiplication will be stored (the DESTINATION is always a register).<br>
`SOURCE` represents the value to be multiplied with the destination.

**Applications:**<br>
Let's assume that the `R1` general register contains a value of 10. We want to multiply this value by 5 and store the result in `R1`. To perform this operation, we can proceed as follows:<br>
`MUL R1, #5` | Here, we use the "MUL" instruction to multiply the value in `R1` by 5.<br>
`Result : R1 = 50`

You can also multiply the value of one register by another, provided that both registers contain the same data types. Imagine we have `R3`, which contains the value 6, and `R4`, which contains the value 8. We want to update the value of `R4` by multiplying it with the value stored in `R3` and storing the result back in `R4`. To perform this operation, we can proceed as follows:<br>
`MUL R4, R3` | Here, we use the "MUL" instruction to multiply the value in `R3` by the value in `R4` and store the result in `R4`.<br>
`Result : R4 = 48`

**What not to do:**<br>
Imagine that our `R1` register contains the string "Hello, World!" and our `R3` register contains the value 20. You cannot use the "MUL" instruction in this case, as the program will attempt to interpret "Hello, World!" as a numerical value.<br>
You'll get a compilation error.

#### 2.4 <u>Division - DIV</u>
The "DIV" (Division) instruction is used in programming languages to divide one value by another, or to divide a value by another and store the result in a specified destination. In our assembly code, the "DIV" operation instruction uses the following syntax:<br>
> `DIV DESTINATION, SOURCE`<br>
`DESTINATION` represents the location where the result of the division will be stored (the DESTINATION is always a register).<br>
`SOURCE` represents the value by which the destination will be divided.

**Applications:**<br>
Let's assume that the `R1` general register contains a value of 50. We want to divide this value by 5 and store the result in `R1`. To perform this operation, we can proceed as follows:<br>
`DIV R1, #5` | Here, we use the "DIV" instruction to divide the value in `R1` by 5.<br>
`Result : R1 = 10`

You can also divide the value of one register by another, provided that both registers contain the same data types. Imagine we have `R3`, which contains the value 40, and `R4`, which contains the value 8. We want to update the value of `R4` by dividing it by the value stored in `R3` and storing the result back in `R4`. To perform this operation, we can proceed as follows:<br>
`DIV R4, R3` | Here, we use the "DIV" instruction to divide the value in `R3` by the value in `R4` and store the result in `R4`.<br>
`Result : R4 = 5`

**What not to do:**<br>
Imagine that our `R1` register contains the string "Hello, World!" and our `R2` register contains the value 20. You cannot use the "DIV" instruction in this case, as the program will attempt to interpret "Hello, World!" as a numerical value.<br>
You'll get a compilation error.

Attempting to divide by zero (0) is not allowed. If you attempt to divide any value by zero, including a constant or the content of a register, it will result in an error or undefined behavior in most programming languages and assembly instructions. For example, `DIV R1, #0` where R1 contains any value will result in an error or an exception, and the program may crash or behave unpredictably. It's important to ensure that the divisor (the value after the "DIV" instruction) is not zero to avoid such issues.

### 3. Functions

Functions in assembly language serve as blocks of code that can be called upon to perform specific tasks. They allow for modular and structured programming.
Functions have a naming convention. Each function must :
- be named in camelCase
- not start with a number
- not be just a number
- not contain any special characters
- not start or end with `_`
  <br><br>
  Here's a general structure for defining functions in our own assembly:

```assembly
.function
    ; Some context and description of the function
    ; OPERANDS Setup: DESTINATION, SOURCE

    ; Function body (code that performs the task)
    
    ; Return value (if any)
    
END
```

**Example of a Function:**

Let's say we want to create a function that adds two numbers and returns the result.

```assembly
.add_numbers
    ; Description: Adds two numbers and returns the result
    ; Input:      OPERANDS Setup: DESTINATION, SOURCE (values to be added)

    ; Code to add the two numbers
    ADD DESTINATION, SOURCE
    
    ; Return to the calling code
    RET
END
```

In this example, `add_numbers` is the function name, and it takes one parameter (`SOURCE`) as input. It calculates the sum of this parameter and stores the result in `DESTINATION`.

#### 3.1 <u>END (End of Function)</u>
The `END` instruction is used to mark the end of a function. It signifies the conclusion of the function's code block and allows the program to continue with the main program or other functions. When the assembler encounters `END` within a function, it understands that the function's code block has concluded, and control returns to the point in the main program where the function was originally called from.

Using `END` is crucial in assembly language to properly terminate functions and ensure that control flow proceeds correctly within the program.

### 4. Subroutines

Subroutines in our assembly are similar to functions, but they are often used for smaller, reusable tasks within a larger program. They typically don't have their own return values but can modify existing variables or registers. Like functions, subroutines use a usage convention. They must :
- be named in camelCase
- not start with a number
- not be just a number
- not contain any special characters
- must start with a `.`<br>
> `CALL .subroutineName`

Here's a general structure for defining subroutines in our assembly:

```assembly
.function
    ; Some context and description of the function
    ; OPERANDS Setup: DESTINATION, SOURCE

    CALL subroutineName;  ; Call the subroutine

    ; More code for the main function

END

.subroutineName
    ; Some context and description of the subroutine
    ; OPERANDS Setup: DESTINATION, SOURCE (if needed)

    ; Subroutine body (code that performs a specific task)

    RET ; Return to the calling code
```

**Example of a Subroutine:**

Let's say we have a main function that calculates the square of a number and a separate subroutine that multiplies two numbers. Here's how it could be structured:

```assembly
.calculate_square
    ; Description: Calculates the square of a number
    ; Input:      OPERANDS Setup: DESTINATION, SOURCE (the number to be squared)

    ; Code to calculate the square using a subroutine
    CALL multiply_numbers ; Call the multiply_numbers subroutine
    MOV DESTINATION, ReturnValue ; Store the result in DESTINATION
    
    ; Return to the calling code
    RET

.multiply_numbers
    ; Description: Multiplies two numbers
    ; Input:      OPERANDS Setup: DESTINATION, SOURCE (values to be multiplied)

    ; Code to multiply the two numbers
    MUL DESTINATION, SOURCE
    
    ; Return to the calling code
    RET

.main
    ; Main function code

    ; Call the calculate_square function
    CALL calculate_square
    
    ; Continue with the main function code

END
```

In this example, `calculate_square` is the main function, and it uses the `multiply_numbers` subroutine to calculate the square of a number. The `multiply_numbers` subroutine performs the multiplication and returns the result in `DESTINATION`. The main function then continues with its code after calling `calculate_square`.

#### 4.1 <u>RET (Return)</u>
The "RET" (Return) instruction is used at the end of a subroutine to return control to the calling code. When a subroutine finishes its task, it uses "RET" to go back to the point in the main program where it was originally called from. This allows the main program to continue executing after the subroutine's task is completed.

Using "RET" is essential in assembly language to maintain program flow and ensure that control is transferred back to the appropriate location in the calling code.

## 5. Variables
For all strings, we enclose them in `""` so that we can retrieve the whole string and so that special characters such as `'` do not differ in the program.<bR>

In our assembly language, you can declare variables using different instructions specific to each variable type. The basic syntax for declaring variables is as follows:

```assembly
variableName defineVariableType value
```

Here's how to declare variables of different types:

### 5.1. <u>DVI (Define Variable Integer)</u>

The "DVI" instruction is used to declare integer variables. It follows this syntax:
```assembly
variableName dvi #1
```
- `variableName` is the variable name
- `dvi` specifies the integer variable type
- `#` specifies that it's an immediate value
- `1` is the initial value of the integer variable

Example:
```assembly
; Declare an integer variable with an initial value of 1
myIntegerVariable dvi #1
```

### 5.2. <u>DVC (Define Variable Char)</u>

The "DVC" instruction is used to declare character variables. It follows this syntax:
```assembly
variableName2 dvc "World! Hello."
```
- `variableName2` is the variable name
- `dvc` specifies the character variable type
- `"World! Hello."` is the initial value of the character variable

Example:
```assembly
; Declare a character variable with an initial value of "World! Hello."
myCharVariable dvc "World! Hello."
```

### 5.3. <u>DVN (Define Variable Negative)</u>

The "DVN" instruction is used to declare integer variables with negative values. It follows this syntax:
```assembly
variableName3 dvn -6
```
- `variableName3` is the variable name
- `dvn` specifies the integer variable type with a negative value
- `-6` is the initial value of the integer variable with a negative value

Example:
```assembly
; Declare an integer variable with a negative initial value of -6
myNegativeVariable dvn -6
```

These instructions allow you to define variables of different types to store data in your assembly language program.

Example usage:
```assembly
; Variable declarations
myIntegerVariable dvi #1
myCharVariable dvc "World! Hello."
myNegativeVariable dvn -6

; Using the variables in the code
...
```

This allows you to define variables of different types to store data in your assembly language program.


### 6. Printing values

In assembly language, printing values to the output or display is a common task. How you print a value depends on whether it's a string, a number, or a register. We use different methods for each:

- To print a **string**, you can use the `DISP "VALUE"` instruction, where `"VALUE"` represents the string you want to display

- To print a **number**, you can use the `DISP VALUE` instruction, where `VALUE` is the numerical value you want to display

- To print the **contents of a register**, you can use the `DISP REGISTERNAME` instruction, where `REGISTERNAME` is the name of the register you want to display

**Examples:**

1. Printing a String:
   ```assembly
   DISP "Hello, World!"
   ```

   This code will display the string "Hello, World!" to the output.

2. Printing a Number:
   ```assembly
   DISP #42       ; Display the value 42
   ```

   This code will display the number 42 to the output.

3. Printing the Contents of a Register:
   ```assembly
   MOV R2, #100   ; Load a value into register R2
   DISP R2       ; Display the contents of register R2
   ```

4. Printing the Address of a Register :
    ```assembly
   MOV A1, R1     ; Load the memory address of R1, in A1
   DISP A1        ; Display the memory address on R1 in A1
   ```

If the value in register R2 is 100, this code will display the number 100 to the output.

### 7. Instructions

In this section, we will look at the instructions that we have decided to implement in our Assembly language. These instructions are used to manipulate registers.

#### 7.1 <u>Instruction MOV</u>
The "MOV" (Move) instruction is used to copy the value from one register to another. It's commonly used for data transfer between registers. The syntax for the "MOV" instruction is as follows:
> `MOV DESTINATION, SOURCE`<br>
> `DESTINATION` represents the location where the data will be stored (the DESTINATION is always a register).
> <br>`SOURCE` represents the value by which the destination will be taken from

Certainly, let's explain each of the "MOV" instruction examples one by one:

#### 7.1.1 `MOV R1, R3`

The instruction `MOV R1, R3` is used to copy the value from register R3 to register R1.

- `R1` is the destination register where the value will be copied
- `R3` is the source register from which the value is taken

Example:
```assembly
MOV R1, R3
```

In this example, the value currently stored in register R3 is copied into register R1. This instruction performs a straightforward data transfer between registers.

#### 7.1.2 `MOV R4, #2`

The instruction `MOV R4, #2` is used to directly load the value `2` into register R4.

- `R4` is the destination register where the value will be placed
- `#2` represents the immediate value `2` that is loaded directly into R4

Example:
```assembly
MOV R4, #2
```

In this example, the value `2` is immediately loaded into register R4. This instruction does not involve copying from another register but directly assigns the value.

#### 7.1.3 `MOV R1, "WORLD ! Hello."`

The instruction `MOV R1, "WORLD ! Hello."` is used to load a string, in this case, `"WORLD ! Hello."`, into register R1.

- `R1` is the destination register where the string will be stored
- `"WORLD ! Hello."` is the string value that will be placed in R1

Example:
```assembly
MOV R1, "WORLD ! Hello."
```

In this example, the string `"WORLD ! Hello."` is stored in register R1. This instruction is used for initialising a register with a string value.

Certainly, I'll add the additional "MOV" instruction examples and the message regarding what not to do. Here's the updated section:

#### 7.1.4 `MOV myTextVariable, "My text"`

The instruction `MOV myTextVariable, "My text"` is used to load a string, in this case, `"My text"`, into the variable `myTextVariable`.

- `myTextVariable` is the destination variable where the string will be stored
- `"My text"` is the string value that will be placed in `myTextVariable`

Example:
```assembly
MOV myTextVariable, "My text"
```

In this example, the string `"My text"` is stored in the variable `myTextVariable`. This is a common way to initialise a string variable.

#### 7.1.5 `MOV myIntegerVariable, #12`

The instruction `MOV myIntegerVariable, #12` is used to assign the integer value `12` to the variable `myIntegerVariable`.

- `myIntegerVariable` is the destination variable where the integer value will be stored
- `12` is the immediate integer value that will be placed in `myIntegerVariable`

Example:
```assembly
MOV myIntegerVariable, #12
```

In this example, the integer value `12` is assigned to the variable `myIntegerVariable`. This is a common way to initialise an integer variable.

#### 7.1.6 What not to do

It's important to follow proper syntax and conventions when using the "MOV" instruction. Avoid the following incorrect usage:

```assembly
MOV 2, "My text"
```

In this incorrect example, the instruction attempts to move a string into the value `2`, which is not a valid variable name or destination. It's crucial to specify a valid destination, such as a register or a named variable, when using the "MOV" instruction. Trying to move data into an invalid destination can result in compilation errors or unexpected behavior.

### 8. Comparing values
The "CMP" (Compare) instruction is used to compare two values. It's essential for making decisions in your program based on the result of the comparison. The "CMP" instruction doesn't alter the values in the operands.

Here are the different forms of the "CMP" instruction:

- `CMP Registre, Variable` : This form compares the contents of a register with the value stored in a memory variable

- `CMP Variable, Variable `: In this case, two memory variables are compared

- `CMP Registre, Registre` : You can compare the contents of two registers using this form

- `CMP DirectValue, DirectValue` : It's also possible to compare two immediate values directly

**Example Usage:**

1. Comparing a Register with a Memory Variable:
   ```assembly
   MOV R1, #42       ; Load value 42 into register R1
   CMP R1, variable1   ; Compare the value in R1 with the content of memory variable variable1
   ```
   The CMP is therefore stored in RAM until it is used. You can therefore perform a conditional jump at any time in the program, which will use this value (if no other CMP has been performed in the meantime in the program).

2. Comparing Two Memory Variables:
   ```assembly
   CMP variable2, variable3   ; Compare the contents of memory variables variable2 and variable2
   ```
   The "CMP" instruction compares the values in variable1 and variable2.

3. Comparing Two Registers:
   ```assembly
   MOV R1, #10       ; Load value 10 into register R1
   MOV R2, #20       ; Load value 20 into register R2
   CMP R1, R2       ; Compare the values in registers R1 and R2
   ```

4. Comparing Immediate Values:
   ```assembly
   CMP #5, #10         ; Compare the immediate values 5 and 10
   ```
   The "CMP" instruction can directly compare two constants.

5. Comparing Register with an Immediate Value :
    ```assembly             
        MOV R1, #2          ; Load value 2 into register R1
        CMP R1, #5          ; Comparing the value in R1 with the immediate value 5
    ```

Example usage:
```assembly
myAge dvi #18           ; Declare a variable named myAge with an initial value of 18
myNewAge dvi #16        ; Declare a variable named myNewAge with an initial value of 16
myName dvc "Jean-Charles" ; Declare a variable named myName with a string value "Jean-Charles"
myFamilyName dvc "DUPONT" ; Declare a variable named myFamilyName with a string value "DUPONT"
actualYear dvi #2023     ; Declare a variable named actualYear with an initial value of 2023

.randomFunction
    ADD myNewAge, #2     ; Add 2 to the value of myNewAge
    CMP myAge, actualYear ; Compare the value of myAge with actualYear
    ; Here you can perform a conditional jump
    RET                 ; Return from the function (subroutine)

.main
    CALL .randomFunction ; Call the randomFunction subroutine
    ; Here you can perform a conditional jump
END   
```

### 9. Jump

#### 9.1 <u>Unconditional jump</u>

**Syntax:**
```
JMP destination
```

The "Jump Unconditional" instruction, represented by `JMP`, transfers control to a different part of the program without any conditions.

**Example:**
```assembly
JMP LoopStart
```

In this example, the program unconditionally jumps to the label `LoopStart`, typically used for implementing loops in assembly.

#### 9.2 <u>Conditional jump</u>

Conditional jumps in assembly allow you to change program flow based on the results of previous comparisons or conditions.

**Syntax:**
```
JXX destination
```

Here, `XX` represents a condition code that specifies the condition under which the jump will be taken.

#### 9.2.1 Jump Equal (JE)

**Syntax:**
```
JE destination
```

The "Jump Equal" (`JE`) instruction jumps to the specified destination if two values are equal.

**Example:**
```assembly
MOV R1, #5     ; Set R1 to 5
CMP R1, #5     ; Compare the value in R1 with 5
JE EqualLabel ; Jump to EqualLabel if R1 equals 5
```

#### 9.2.2 Jump Not Equal (JNE)

**Syntax:**
```
JNE destination
```

The "Jump Not Equal" (`JNE`) instruction jumps to the specified destination if two values are not equal.

**Example:**
```assembly
MOV R2, #10    ; Set R2 to 10
CMP R2, #5     ; Compare the value in R2 with 5
JNE NotEqual  ; Jump to NotEqual if R2 is not equal to 5
```

#### 9.2.3 Jump Greater (JG)

**Syntax:**
```
JG destination
```

The "Jump Greater" (`JG`) instruction jumps to the specified destination if one value is greater than another.

**Example:**
```assembly
MOV R3, #15    ; Set R3 to 15
CMP R3, #10    ; Compare the value in R3 with 10
JG Greater    ; Jump to Greater if R3 is greater than 10
```

#### 9.2.4 Jump Greater or Equal (JGE)

**Syntax:**
```
JGE destination
```

The "Jump Greater or Equal" (`JGE`) instruction jumps to the specified destination if one value is greater than or equal to another.

**Example:**
```assembly
MOV R4, #20    ; Set R4 to 20
CMP R4, #20    ; Compare the value in R4 with 20
JGE GreaterOrEqual ; Jump to GreaterOrEqual if R4 is greater than or equal to 20
```

#### 9.2.5 Jump Less (JL)

**Syntax:**
```
JL destination
```

The "Jump Less" (`JL`) instruction jumps to the specified destination if one value is less than another.

**Example:**
```assembly
MOV R1, #25    ; Set R1 to 25
CMP R1, #30    ; Compare the value in R1 with 30
JL Less       ; Jump to Less if R1 is less than 30
```

#### 9.2.6 Jump Less or Equal (JLE)

**Syntax:**
```
JLE destination
```

The "Jump Less or Equal" (`JLE`) instruction jumps to the specified destination if one value is less than or equal to another.

**Example:**
```assembly
MOV R2, #5     ; Set R2 to 5
CMP R2, #5     ; Compare the value in R2 with 5
JLE LessOrEqual ; Jump to LessOrEqual if R2 is less than or equal to 5
```

Conditional jumps are used to control program flow based on comparisons and conditions, allowing you to create branching logic in assembly programs.

### 10. Bitwise operations

Bitwise operations in assembly manipulate individual bits of binary values.

#### 10.1 <u>AND (Logical AND)</u>

**Syntax:**
```
AND destination, source
```

The `AND` instruction performs a bitwise AND operation between the bits of the destination and source operands, setting the bits in the destination to 1 only if both corresponding bits in the source and destination are 1.

**Example:**
```assembly
MOV R1, #5     ; Set R1 to binary 0101
MOV R2, #3     ; Set R2 to binary 0011
AND R1, R2    ; Perform AND operation: R1 = 0101 AND 0011 = 0001 (1 in decimal)
```

#### 10.2 <u>XOR (Exclusive OR)</u>

**Syntax:**
```
XOR destination, source
```

The `XOR` instruction performs a bitwise XOR operation between the bits of the destination and source operands, setting the bits in the destination to 1 if they differ in value between the source and destination.

**Example:**
```assembly
MOV R1, #6     ; Set R1 to binary 0110
MOV R2, #3     ; Set R2 to binary 0011
XOR R1, R2    ; Perform XOR operation: R1 = 0110 XOR 0011 = 0101 (5 in decimal)
```

#### 10.3 <u>NOT (Logical NOT)</u>

**Syntax:**
```
NOT destination
```

The `NOT` instruction performs a bitwise NOT operation on the destination operand, inverting all of its bits (changing 0s to 1s and vice versa).

**Example:**
```assembly
MOV R1, #5     ; Set R1 to binary 0101
NOT R1        ; Perform NOT operation: R1 = NOT 0101 = 1010 (10 in decimal)
```

#### 10.4 <u>OR (Logical OR)</u>

**Syntax:**
```
OR destination, source
```

The `OR` instruction performs a bitwise OR operation between the bits of the destination and source operands, setting the bits in the destination to 1 if either the source or destination bit is 1.

**Example:**
```assembly
MOV R1, #6     ; Set R1 to binary 0110
MOV R2, #3     ; Set R2 to binary 0011
OR R1, R2     ; Perform OR operation: R1 = 0110 OR 0011 = 0111 (7 in decimal)
```

Bitwise operations are commonly used for various tasks in assembly language, such as manipulating individual flags or data masks. These instructions allow you to work with the binary representation of data at the bit level.

### 11. Get Address (GAD)

The "GAD" instruction, which stands for "Get Address," is used to obtain the memory address of a specific register and store it in one of the destination registers, which can be A1, A2, A3, or A4.

**Syntax:**
```
GAD DESTINATION, SOURCE
```

- `DESTINATION` represents one of the address registers (A1, A2, A3, or A4)
- `SOURCE` represents the source register (e.g., R1, R2, R3, R4) whose memory address you want to obtain

**Example:**
```assembly
MOV R1, #10    ; Set R1 to the value 10
GAD A1, R1   ; Get the memory address of R1 and store it in A1
```

In this example, the `GAD A1, R1` instruction retrieves the memory address of register `R1` and stores it in register `A1`. Now, `A1` contains the memory address of `R1`, allowing you to perform operations that involve the address of R1, such as indirect addressing or memory manipulation.

### 12. Error handling

| Error Code | Type of Error                   | Message                                                                                                                       |
|------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00       | Unexpected error                | Oops... a problem in the matrix has been detected. Go to GitHub issues for help.                                              |
| 0x01       | File not found                  | The file was not found. Check the name and/or directory in which the file is located.                                         |
| 0x02       | File secured with a password    | Unable to access the file, which is password-protected                                                                        |

## VI. Glossary
[^1]: **Virtual Processor**: A virtual processor refers to a simulated or emulated computing unit designed to execute instructions and perform operations, typically in a software environment. It mimics the behavior of a physical processor, allowing for testing and development without the need for actual hardware.
[^2]: **Interpreter**: An interpreter is a software component that reads and executes source code or scripts in real-time, without the need for prior compilation. It translates and executes the code line by line, making it suitable for scripting languages and dynamic environments.
[^3]: **Assembly Code**: Assembly code, also known as assembly language, is a low-level programming language that represents instructions in a human-readable form, closely resembling the architecture of a computer's central processing unit (CPU). It is used for direct hardware manipulation and optimisation.
[^4]: **C Language**: The C language is a high-level, general-purpose programming language renowned for its efficiency, portability, and expressive power. It serves as a versatile tool for software development and system programming.
[^5]: **Libraries**: Libraries are collections of pre-written code modules or functions that provide reusable and standardised functionality to simplify software development. They are commonly used to extend the capabilities of a programming language.
[^6]: **Dependencies**: Dependencies are external software components or libraries that a program relies on to function correctly. They must be present and correctly configured for the program to operate as intended.
[^7]: **x86 Architecture**: In computer science, an instruction in x86 architecture is a specific command or operation that tells an x86 processor what to do. Instructions are the basic building blocks that enable a computer to perform tasks such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, loading data into memory, and more. Each instruction is encoded as binary text that the processor can understand and is a fundamental step in executing computer programs.
[^8]: **32 bits**: In computer architecture, "32-bit" refers to the size or width of data that a processor can handle at a time. It signifies that the processor can process 32 bits of data in a single operation. This measurement is often used to describe the capabilities of a CPU, memory addressing, and the data width of the operating system or applications. A 32-bit system can theoretically address up to 4 gigabytes (GB) of memory and is commonly used in older computer systems and operating systems. However, 64-bit systems have become more prevalent in modern computing due to their ability to handle larger amounts of memory and perform more efficiently with 64-bit software.
[^9]: **Case Sensitive**: Case sensitive refers to a characteristic of a computer system or software where distinctions are made between uppercase (capital) and lowercase (small) letters in text. In a case-sensitive system, "A" and "a" are considered as two different characters and are treated separately. For example, "Word" and "word" would be considered distinct words in a case-sensitive context, while in a case-insensitive context, they would be treated as the same word.
