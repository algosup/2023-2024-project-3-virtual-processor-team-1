# Important information

Jira, crafted by Atlassian, stands out as a widely embraced project management and issue-tracking tool within diverse industries. It facilitates the planning, tracking, and successful release of software, offering a versatile and adaptable platform designed to cater to the unique requirements of different teams and projects.

**Centralised project management:**

Jira acts as a central hub for all your project management activities, consolidating essential information in one accessible location. From creating and assigning tasks to monitoring progress and generating reports, Jira streamlines the management process.

**Rich Formatting Options:**

Jira provides robust formatting options, allowing us to present and organize information in a clear and visually appealing manner. This feature contributes to better communication and understanding of project details.

**Real-time collaboration:**

Jira fosters seamless collaboration, allowing team members to effortlessly communicate, share updates, and stay abreast of the latest project developments in real-time. This enhances communication channels and overall team cohesion.

**Customisable workflows:**

Tailoring Jira to match your team's distinct processes is a breeze. Define custom workflows, issue types, and fields to align the tool precisely with your project's unique requirements, promoting a more tailored and efficient project management experience.

**Integration with popular tools:**

Jira seamlessly integrates with various third-party tools and platforms such as GitHub, Slack, and Confluence. This integration establishes a unified ecosystem, eliminating the need to juggle between different applications and fostering a smoother workflow.

**Cost-effective solution:**

One notable advantage is Jira's free version, which presents a cost-effective solution for our work management requirements. This resonates with our objective of optimizing resources while still benefiting from the robust capabilities of a leading project management tool.

An account is required to get access to the Jira project, for this, these information are required:

* A name
* An email address
* A password

A validation code will be sent to this email address, therefore you need to have access to it.

This step should take you less than 2 minutes to do.

![Summary](./Appendices/summary.png)

Now that you are part of the Jira project, you have access to multiple tabs that are used to organise and track the progress of the project.

There are 3 main tabs that we would like you to take into account.

![Tabs](./Appendices/tabs.png)

## List / Board

[Board link](https://virtual-processor.atlassian.net/jira/core/projects/VPT1/board)

These two tabs have the same information but not the same format. This allows people to choose their favourite or easiest way to see the information.

In these tabs, you can find the tasks that have been assigned to the team. For each task you have:

* An id â†’ VPT1-x (VirtualProcessorTeam1-number of the task)
* A name
* A description
* The status
* A category
* The assignee
* The start date
* The end date
* The priority
* Comments

There are two types of tasks, the main and the sub-tasks. When a task has an arrow in front of its type, it means that they are divided into multiple tasks.
