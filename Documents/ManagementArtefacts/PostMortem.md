## Introduction

This document outlines the key takeaways from the virtual processor project. It highlights areas where the team performed well, identifies shortcomings, and proposes solutions for future projects.

The postmortem of this project has been done on March 11th, 2024.

## What went well

* Strong presentation
    * The final presentation was well-received due to thorough preparation and a clear explanation of the project steps
* Teamwork
    * Team cohesion and collaboration were evident throughout the project
    * Team members readily helped one another, demonstrating personal engagement and flexibility in roles
* Project management
    * The initial project breakdown was effective, with tasks and code completion occurring ahead of schedule
* Overtime dedication
    * Team members invested extra time beyond project hours to ensure success
* Complex code
    * Decided to include the machine code
    * Implementation of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

## Areas for Improvement

* Software engineering communication
    * Instances of duplicate work arose due to a lack of communication among software engineers regarding task ownership
* Inclusive decision-making:
    * Not all team members felt included in key decisions, potentially hindering overall engagement
* Scope management
    * Scope changes occurred at the start of the project, even before the start of the development
* Documentation utilisation
    * Written materials weren't always consulted by the team, leading to knowledge gaps.
* Communication flow
    * Some team members encountered roadblocks but didn't inform others, hindering collaborative problem-solving
* Distractions
    * Personal or team-related distractions occasionally impact productivity

## Lessons Learned

* Presentation
    * No introduction of the team at the beginning
    * Ensure clear explanations of the project scope
    * Prepare extensively for Q&A sessions
    * Minimise presenter transitions for a smoother flow
    * Adjust presentation pace for optimal information delivery
* Software engineering communication
    * Assign specific tasks instead of allowing open selection
    * Implement clear communication channels for task ownership
* Scope management
    * Discuss scope internally before client conversations
    * Develop a well-defined and documented project scope
* Implementation
    * Encourage team-wide documentation review to ensure comprehension
    * Foster an environment where team members actively participate in documentation updates
* Decision-making
    * Brainstorm solutions and make choices collaboratively

## Conclusion

The virtual processor project provided valuable insights for future projects. By fostering stronger communication, refining scope management practices, and implementing new approaches to documentation and decision-making, the team is well-positioned for future projects.
