## Decision making

The project seems to be very complex and needs further information to be understandable for everyone. The main goal of the next week will be to get the team at the same level of understanding about the project.

Time is going fast, we need to focus on the functional and technical parts of the project as soon as possible.

Even if we manage to succeed on these points, it already seems that we are going to have a delay on the project. Following this interpretation, the possible delay will be discussed during the meeting with the client.
